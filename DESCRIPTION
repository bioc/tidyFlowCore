Description: tidyFlowCore bridges the gap between flow cytometry analysis using the 
    flowCore Bioconductor package and the tidy data principles advocated by the tidyverse. It provides 
    a suite of dplyr-, ggplot2-, and tidyr-like verbs specifically designed for working with flowFrame 
    and flowSet objects as if they were tibbles; however, your data remain flowCore
    data structures under this layer of abstraction. tidyFlowCore enables 
    intuitive and streamlined analysis workflows that can leverage both the 
    Bioconductor and tidyverse ecosystems for cytometry data.
